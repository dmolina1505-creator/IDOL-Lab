# IDOL-Lab
A casual K-pop management &amp; trainee-life simulation game.  IdoLab is a hybrid K-pop simulation game inspired by titles like Monthly Idol and Idol Manager. The game lets you experience both sides of the industry: the sharp suit of a CEO running an entertainment company, and the messy, chaotic, adrenaline-filled path of a trainee fighting to debut.
